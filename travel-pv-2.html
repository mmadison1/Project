          For our trip to the Amalfi Coast, we went through an organization
          called "Bus to Alps" Bus2Alps was a great way to travel with a group
          of people and provided a set plan. While we had to pay for our flight
          tickets separately, the Bus2Alps programs provided us with
          transportation to and from the Rome airport, housing accommodations, as
          well as activities during the 3 days. The trip leaders were awesome
          and showed us so many different areas of the Amalfi Coast that we
          never would have been able to find on our own. On our first day, we
          took a double decker boat to Positano where we got off and spent the
          day on our own. The next day, we went cliff jumping in an off the road
          cove. I absolutely loved this trip.

          We visited Munich, Germany for the sole purpose of Oktoberfest.
          Oktoberfest is the world's largest beet festival held annually in
          Munich, Germany. This was the trip that we had to plan ahead the most.
          So, we booked our flights and our accommodations (The Holiday Inn)
          around July. Throughout the weekend, we took the public transportation
          back and forth to the Oktoberfest site. Story time! On the first day,
          we arrived in line at 6 AM in the pouring rain and waited 3 HOURS!
          This was until the gates were open and we sprinted to grab a table in
          the Hofbrauhaus tent. It was brutal but worth it.

        <p>Portugal was an amazing low-key weekend after 2 crazy and jam-packed trips.
            In Portugal, we decided to stay in an Air Bnb where the 3 of us each had our own room, a living room, 2 bathrooms, 
            and a kitchen. We started out the weekend with a great brunch and guided tour of the city. The following day, we took 
            an uber to the Pena National Palace followed by a scenic seafood lunch by the beach. After we rested up, we finished the trip with an amazing 
            Italian dinner in Lisbon.

      <p>Prague was definitely one of my favorite cities. It is full of rich history, tasty food, as well as cool bars and clubs.
          I traveled to Prague alongside 5 of my friends. We stayed in a hotel right in the middle of the square. This was the perfect location because we were able 
          to walk everywhere. We started off our day just walking along the square. This walk ultimately brought us to the Jewish Quarter. 
          Next, we walked across the iconic Charles Bridge which separates and also connects the two separate sides of the city. Our walk 
          brought us to the Lennon Wall. We then took a taxi to the Prague Castle. The next day, we had preplanned a private 
          wine tasting boat tour on the Charles River. I would highly recommend this. We found this through Trip Advisor. After the one hour 
          boat tour, we made our way over to the Manifesto Market. This was an outdoor space filled with over 20 food trucks with a variety 
          sorting from Indian food to seafood to Spanish tapas and basically anything you could name.

        <p>I am absolutely in love with Dublin. The people are so friendly and speak English which is nice to hear when you 
            can't understand people for 4 months! On the first day in Dublin, I toured the iconic Jameson Site and Guinness Factory. These are both 
            must sees. In addition, I visited the Dublin Castle and St. Patrick's Cathedral. On my second day in Dublin, I woke up at the crack of dawn 
            to catch a tour to the Cliffs of Moher. I planned this tour through Trip Advisor. The drive was 3 hours both ways, but the view 
            was 100% worth it. After this, I walked around the Temple Bar area and enjoyed the live music that they played in every bar.

        <p>I absolutely loved Milan. I stayed in the Park Hyatt located right next to the Grand Gallery
            which is filled with restaurants and high end stores. After walking through the Grand Gallery you will run right into
            the town square where the amazing Duomo is located. On my second day in Milan, I was lucky enough to be able to attend 
            the annual <a href="https://www.fieradeltartufo.org/en/">Truffle Festival</a> in Alba about a 2 hour drive from Milan.

      <p>Wow! I absolutely adored Paris. I had never been and could not have been more excited. On my first day, I started at the Arch de Triumph
          and continued my way down Champs-Elysees. In addition, a few friends and I 
        had a private wine tasting which we also booked through Trip Advisor! On my second day, I of course had to visit the Eiffel Tower
    as well as the Louvre and other surrounding museums. I ended my day at a Christmas Market. </p>

        <p>I visited London during Thanksgiving because one of my best friends from school lives there! 
            I stayed in her house in Mayfair which was an amazing location to get to any central sites in London. 
            After celebrating Thanksgiving, the next few days we walked around the city and visited the Christmas Market multiple times. 
            Some of the sites that we visited were Big Ben, the Tower Bridge,
            St. Paul's Cathedral, and of course Westminster Abbey. If you love to browse or shop, make sure you visit Selfridges on Oxford Street
            and Harrods.

    <p><strong>Berlin, Germany</strong></p>

    </ul>
        <p>Berlin was an amazing place to end my journey abroad. I started my first day with a tour of the 
            Brandenburg Gate, Reichstag, Berlin Wall Memorial, German Historical Museum, The Jewish Museum
            and ended our tour at the Checkpoint Charlie Museum. These are all must sees when visiting Berlin.
            My favorite part of the trip was the huge Christmas Market.
